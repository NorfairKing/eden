## EDEN
Euler Development ENgine

EDEN was built to take the hastle out of solving Project Euler problems.

When solving these problems you want to be thinking about the solutions.
You don't want to mess around with how to compile your solutions and how to run them.
Ideally you would just write your solution's source file and automagically find out what
 its result is.

EDEN takes care of all the hastle in solving project euler problem.
EDEN will...

- ... generate the appropriate directory structure
- ... build your solutions
- ... run your solutions
- ... test your solutions
- ... take care of shared libraries for your solutions
- ... test those libraries
- ... help you with publishing writeups of your solutions

EDEN will make Project Euler more fun.
